# COVID-19 Case Study: Data Analysis with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

This repository contains a case study analyzing COVID-19 data. The primary goal of this project is to practice and strengthen data analysis skills using core Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- Loading and preprocessing COVID-19 data
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Time-series trend analysis of confirmed cases and deaths
- Visualizations for better understanding of the data
- Statistical insights and observations

## File Included

- `Covid_19_CaseStudy.ipynb` â€“ the complete Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and analysis.

## Purpose

This case study serves as a practice project to build confidence in data analysis using Python, especially focusing on:

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Plotting and trend analysis
- Handling real-world datasets with time series components

## Dataset

The dataset used contains daily counts of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 across various regions.
